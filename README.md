# U.S-Household-Income
This set of SQL queries was designed for an exploratory analysis of U.S. household income data, drawing from the US_Project.us_household_income and US_Project.us_household_income_statistics tables. Key components of the analysis include data selection, aggregation, and filtering to gain insights into income distribution and demographic statistics across various states, counties, and city types. 


Initial Data Overview:

Retrieve all records from us_household_income and us_household_income_statistics tables to explore the overall dataset.
Geographic Data Aggregation:

Calculate the total land and water area per state, sorting by largest land and water area. This provides a geographical context for income data analysis by state.
Data Merging and Filtering:

Join income data with statistics on household income where the mean income is not zero, allowing focused analysis on meaningful records.
Extract specific columns like state, county, income type, and mean/median income to examine detailed income patterns.
Income Statistics by State:

Calculate and rank average mean and median income across states, sorted in ascending and descending order to highlight states with the highest and lowest income values.
Income Analysis by Type:

Calculate the average mean and median income for different income types (e.g., Community) to observe income variations by category, filtering for types with significant sample sizes.
City-Level Income Analysis:

Compute and rank mean and median incomes for each city within states, providing a granular view of income distribution at the city level.
This portfolio demonstrates skills in SQL querying, data aggregation, filtering, and analysis. It showcases an ability to leverage data to gain insights into socioeconomic patterns across geographic regions in the U.S., relevant to data-driven decision-making and regional economic assessments.
